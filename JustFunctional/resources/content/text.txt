Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison. 
He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices.
Tesla is also known for his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York.
